    quote: 'First of all, Deeba does incredible work to a very high standard. When I met her in February, I was so depressed, I had low self-esteem and didn\'t even realise it before my consultation with her. Now, I look back to who I was and so much has changed! She genuinely has the best interests at heart for her clients and still remains so professional. Our sessions were hard, but I looked forward to them every week as I knew that the work she put into helping me was all worth it!',
  },
  {
    quote: 'She is loving and caring, but most importantly, won\'t lie to you. The line between neutrality and apathy is a hard one to balance, but somehow she manages to stay compassionate while neutral and judgement-free. Thanks to Deeba, I\'ve been able to learn how to self-regulate, stop spiralling, hold myself to account and also show myself kindness. These changes have been reflected in all areas of my life and her Islamic approach to things really helps to put it all into perspective. Thank you so much Deeba!”',
