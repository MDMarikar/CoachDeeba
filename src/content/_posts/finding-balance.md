Have you ever felt like life is a nonstop hamster wheel?  The days are blurred, the clock keeps ticking, and you’re constantly on your toes. Maybe you find yourself immersed in a constant cycle of never-ending tasks you’re in between cleaning, cooking, work, running kids to events, social gatherings, etc. etc. The endless task of doing becomes the norm. Maybe your sense of purpose relies on checking off your list. When you’ve had a “productive day” you feel accomplished and worthy when you haven’t checked it all off (probably most days) you feel like you’re not good enough (a bit useless). Why is that?

Or maybe you are living in a constant state of fear of the future. You’re worried your parents will pass away, something bad will happen to someone you love, things will fall apart, or you’ll lose your livelihood. If you think about it, the possibility of fear-driven outcomes is endless. 

At the centre of all these examples is forgetting. We forget our true place and purpose for living. We are not more or less worthy because of the things we accomplish. The possibility of tragedy and catastrophe are just as likely as the possibility of success, beauty, and fulfilment. But when we focus on fear, lack, and unworthiness, that becomes our reality. 

Have you ever read an impactful book, post online, or even a poignant meme? It could have impacted you for hours, days or if it was quite profound, on and off for a few months. The problem is that in between remembering, we forget. We fall back into doubt, uncertainty, and lack. If you are in between states, your life will reflect that. You’re up and down, back and forth, trying to stabilize but never quite getting there. 
Bani Adam forgets. 

We forget our Creator created us with inherent worth, He SWT tells us we are the best of creation, and it is our job to remember the possibility of our greatness. Our true nature is deep within us, we know who we are, but through life experience, what people tell us, self-sabotage and how we interpret the events around us, we get derailed. It’s up to us to remember. Not just once-in-a-while, or through bouts of inspiration, but every day, with purpose. When we remind ourselves as a practice, we become who we are meant to be, we fulfil our potential and become the architects of our own lives.
